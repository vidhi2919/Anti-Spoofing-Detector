**Anti-Spoofing Detector**
This project focuses on developing an **anti-spoofing detector** to enhance security in computer vision applications. The model is built using **deep learning frameworks** like TensorFlow  to detect spoofed images, improving the accuracy and reliability of identity verification systems. The solution aims to provide stronger protection against spoofing attacks in areas like face recognition and biometric authentication.
